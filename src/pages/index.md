  title: Why Quilts
  description: >
    We believe that quilts shouldn't just taste good, they should do good too.
    We source all of our quilts directly from small scale sustainable quilt
    farmers and make sure part of the profits are reinvested in their
    communities.
description: We are the ultimate spot for quilt lovers who want to learn about
  their quilt's origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take quilt
  production seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to anyone.

        Love a great quilt, but never knew how to make one? Bought a fancy new
        sewing machine but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our quilters
        to learn anything you want to know about quilting and sewing. Email us
        or call the store for details.

        We believe that quilts have the power to bring people together. That’s
        why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting space
        where you can hang out with fellow quilt lovers and learn about quilt
        making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for sale. The
        full price you pay goes to the artist.

  heading: Great quilts with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our quilts to the highest standards from the shrub to full grown.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the quilt's
    journey. We personally visit each quilt farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the quilts, farmers and the local environment.
